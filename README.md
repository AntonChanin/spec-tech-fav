## Timeing

This repo version:

- ui, page, project structure and styles from V1, init repo, types, assets, animation, google - 4h
- validate and extend prev iteration content - 2h
- sound effect, local storage and bugfix - 3h

I'm not added state management at this moment but think later about mobX for this task.
I think that subtask bite my time less 1h. But if that Redux m.b more than 1h.
